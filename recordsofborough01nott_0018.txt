‘Anno Domini 920. Rex Edwardus, frater Elfledae‚ §notingham
cepit, et resarcivit3 in qua Danos simul et Anglos posuit. Post
haec, in australi parte fluminis Trent urbem contra antiquam urbem
construxit, inter utramque urbem firmum pontem ponens.'2 It
would be of interest if we could ascertain whether this historical
note was excerpted from the Red Book or was simply a note of
Gregory‘s. It appears to be merely a paraphrase of the words
of Florence of worcester? and may have been derived by Gregory
from the then recently published edition of Lord William Howard.
The second of these collections is ascribed to william Greavcs on
the authority of an entry at p. 27: ‘Transcript 4to 7briS, 1671, per
me W. Greaves' (Λα, ‘transcribed by me, W. Greaves, 4th September,
1671 ’>. These papers consist of 62 pages of foolscap, almost wholly
in the handwriting of William Greaves. This person was the son
of William Greaves, Rector of Ν uthall, who was the brother of Robert
Greaves‚ Town Clerk, 1617-1643, and 1652-6 (he having been de-
prived of his office on account of his connection with the Royalists
at Newark). Robert and william Greaves were nephews of W illiam
Gregory, so there is a special fitness in the younger william Greaves’
papers being ranked with those of his great-uncle. william Greaves,
MA„ the compiler of the above paperS, was an Alderman of Not-
tingham and Registrar of the Archdeacon's Court in Thoroton's
time. According to an entry in his papers (p. 9), ‘Will Greaves,
Artium Magister‚’ was sworn a Burgess in 1661. He was sub-
sequently elected Mayor, and occupied a prominent position in the

resistance to the attempts of Charles ΙΙ. to obtain possession of

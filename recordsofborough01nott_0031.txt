ham, greeting and the apostolic benediction. It is seemly that those
intent upon pious deeds should be supported with the favour of the
authority committed to us, so that they may the more easily perfect
the fruit of good work, when they are seeured against temporal an-
noyances by the apostolic protection. Wherefore, beloved sons in the
Lord, having regard to the laudable and pious intention which we
hear you [entertain] of receiving the poor and needy, we take your
house, with everything which at this present time you possess justly
and without controversy, or which you may acquire, with the help of
the Lord, by just means in the future, under Saint Peter-'s and our
protection, and we secure them to you by the support of this present
writing‚ but especially the site of your house, with the gardens and
all its appurtenances. We also orclain that no one shall presume to
exact or extort tithes from you of your gardens or trees, or of the
fodder of your animals. Let no one therefore infringe or heedlessly
dare to act contrary to this evidence of our protectior] or ordinance;
but if any one presume to attempt this, let him know that he will
incur the indignation of Almighty God, and of Saints Peter and Paul
His Apostles. Given at Viterbo on the 13th of the kalends of April.

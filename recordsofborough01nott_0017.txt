examination of their details.’ This examination they have now
received, and it is to be hoped that the results of such examination,
as embodied in the following sheets‚ will not belie the remarks of
one who had an unrivalled acquaintance with the records of our
medieval towns. Considerable light is thrown upon the history of
personal names by these early rolls, which the exigencies of space
forbid us noticing here.

5. There are two sources which for convenience may be treated
together. These are, william Gregory's ‘Notes of the Contents of
the Red Book,'1 and the collection referred to as ‘Greaves’ Papers.’2
Both of these works consist of material drawn, apparently, from the
lost Red Book of the town. The former of these collections is
written in a very small fine hand which is easily recognizable as that
of william Gregory, who filled the post of Mayor‘s (or Town) Clerk
from 1596 to 1617, and also represented the town in Parliament in
1601 and 1614. Any doubt as to the correctness of the assignation
of these papers to Gregory is set at rest by the occurrence of the
signature ‘Wm Gregory' at fo. 9d. The longer extracts in these
papers are written in an engrossing hand, and Gregory has added
marginal notes in his own writing. The work as now preserved
consists of 24 pages, which commence with the Constitutions made
by Darne Agnes Mellers for her Free School, following which is an
abstract of Thomas Mellers’ will, the page being headed in Gregory's
hand ‘out of the great Redd book.' Then follow four pages written
in the legal hand (probably by a clerk of Gregory’s), after which
Gregory’s hand appears again with the heading ‘Noates os the
Contentes of the Redd book.' It is quite clear, therefore, that these
notes were derived from the lost Red Book of the town, though the
originals of many of the royal letters and other deeds are still pre-
served, they being, doubtlessly, copied into the Red Book. Gregory’s
‘Notes,' with the exception of the copies of deeds written in the
other hand, are of a very brief nature, as may be gathered from

422 RECORDS OF THE BOROUGH OF NOTTINGHAM. [1300

111.—L2'st ef Mayors‚ Batlff, etc.
1281-1399.

 

This List is compiled from the occurrences of the names of the Mayors and Bailiffs as
Witnesses to Charters, and from the names given in the Court Rolls upon various occasions.
As the term of the office of Mayors and Bailiffs extended from September 29 in one year
to September 29 in the following year, the employment of two dates in the following list
is rendered necessary. These dates have been obtained by computing the term of office
by the date of the occurrence of the names. Thus, the names of John 16 Paumer, junior,
Mayor, John le Bere and Adam le Flamang, Bailiffs, occur February 22, 1303 (N.S.):
therefore, their term of office commenced September 29, 1302, and ended at that date
in 1303. IIence they occur in this List under 1302-3. So far as it has been possible
to check this system of computation, it has met with unvarying confirmation. The
names occurring in brackets are surmised from their occurrence during the Mayoralty
immediately following the one assigned to them here. They are then described as ‘late'
(nuper) Mayor and Bailisfs, and it is clear that only those whose term of office has just
cxpired are so described: otherS, whose term of office was a few years removed from the
reference to them, being described, in every case, as ‘ sometime (quondam) Mayor,' etc.

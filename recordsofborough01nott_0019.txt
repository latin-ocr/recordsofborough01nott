the town Charters, which were, however, surrendered through the
treachery of the Mayor, Gervase Wild. For his opposition to these
unconstitutional proceedings william Greaves was tried in the Court
of King's Bench, 1684, before the infamous Chief Justice Jeffries.
Greaves died in 1697, aged 77, and was buried in S. Mary’s Church,
where his epitaph (printed by Deering, p. 28) paid a just tribute to
his exertions on behalf of the municipal liberties of the borough.
There is no indication in Greaves' papers of the source whence
they were derived, but there is every reason to believe that, like
Gregory's collection of notes, they were drawn from the lost Red
Book. This may be gathered from several brief notes of entries in
the Red Book given by Gregory, whereof full copies are given by
*Greaves Thus, Gregory, fo. 8, gives a brief abstract of the Rules
of S. John’s Hospital: given in full by Greaves (see No. XVI., p. 28
post). Gregory then remarks; ‘There ys the byshops visitacion sett
downe upon the Inquirie of the usage and state of the howse.1
Many grantes of much landes in dyuers places to the same howse;
butt all went away by the dissolucion. Confirmed by K. H. 3, and
he gaves 3 acres of land in Nott. to the palmers of Nott.2 A bull

It is evident from these remarks that the charters and bulls relating

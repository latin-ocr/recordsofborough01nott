know that, whereas contention had arisen between the Prior and Con-
vent of Lenton, on the one part, and the Mayor and Burgesses of
Nottingham, on the other, in regard to the fair of Lenton, in certain
liberties pertaining to that fair, the said contention between them is
at length, through the mediation of discreet men, amicably settled in
this wise : to wit, that the said Prior and Convent, by the unanimous
assent and common counsel 01 111611 Chapter, have released and quit-
claimed to the Mayor and Burgesses of Nottingham, and their heirs,
four days 01 1116 increment of their fair of Lenton, which the Lord
Henry King 01 England, son of King John, granted to them, and by
his charter confirmed: so that the said Prior and Convent, and their
successors, shall not hold the fair except for eight days fully com-
plete, and the fair shall begin on the eve 01 Saint Martin, and shall
endure from the morning 011116 531116 day until the end 01 1116 eighth

who wish to hire booths in the fair 01 Lenton, shall give for each

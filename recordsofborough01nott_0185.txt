1355, April.

Peter,1 Prior of Lenton, complainant, by his attorney, appeared
against &Valter 16 Goldsmith, defendant, on a plea of agreement; and
he complains that, whereas the same Peter, on Monday next before
the feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the
29th year of the reign of the present king,2 at Nottingham, in the
house of the same W'alter, by one Dawnestes, his fellow-monk, agreed
with the said W'alter to repair a vessel 01 crystal to carry the body
01 Our Lord Jesus Christ, with pure silver and gold, the same XValter
broke the agreement thereupon made between them, in these three
particulars: in not making the said vessel of pure silver, nor well and
suitably gilding it, and in soldering the aforesaid vessel with tin,
whereas he should have soldered it with silver, to the serious damage
of the said Prior 01 100 shillings, wherefore he enters suit. And
the aforesaid Walter comes, and says that he has broken no agree-
ment hereupon made between them, as the same Prior has set forth
against him, but that he repaired well and suitably the aforesaid
vessel, and this he will verify by a good inquest; and the aforesaid
Prior likewise. Therefore it is ordered that a good inquest be surn-
moned against the next Court between the parties aforesaid.

Peter, Prior 01 Lenton, complainant, appeared against XValter le
Goldsmith, defendant, on a plea of debt; and he makes plaint
that 116 unjustly withholds from him a noble and a halfpenny of
gold, and unjustly because, whereas the same Peter the Prior, on
Monday next before the feast of the Purification of the Blessed
Virgin Mary, in the 29th year of the reign of the present king, at
Nottingham, by his servant, delivered to the same Walter two nobles
of gold, to gild a vessel of crystal with, to carry the body 01 Our Lord
Jesus Christ, which vessel he gilded with a halfpenny; the same Prior,
by his aforesaid servant, came and sought the aforesaid noble and
halfpenny3 the same W'alter would not pay them, but withheld 1116111,

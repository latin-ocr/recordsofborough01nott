1395, October 6.

Hugh spicer, of Nottingham, makes plaint of William Huntston
and Thomas Sherman, of Nofflngham, on a plea of detention of
chattels: pledges of prosecuting-—Hugh Bell and John Fox: and he
makes plaint that the said william and Thomas, on Thursday next
after the feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the
18th year of the reign of King Richard who now is,1 at which time
they were Bailiffs of Nottingham‚ took four doors of the said Hugh's
from his tenement at that time lying in the Castelgate in Notting-
ham, of the value of 135. 4d.‚ for two shillings of the rent of the
Lord King issuing from the said tenement each year, which doors,
although the said Hugh had very often requested them from the said
day up to the present time, and would have paid the Lord King's rent,
the said william and Thomas withheld‚ and to this time withhold,
delivery of the said doors, to the damage of the aforesaid Hugh of
405, wherefore he enters suit, etc. And the aforesaid william and
Thomas come in their own persons, and defend the force and injury
and damage5‚ ete, and they say that it is the use and custom of the
aforesaid town of Nottingham, and was so from old time, for the
Bailiffs for the time being of the town of Nottingham to retain
pledges taken for the rent and amercements of the Lord King for
a year and a day next after the end of their office, and after the said
year and day to proclaim the said pledges in full Court who would
redeem their pledges so taken and make payment of those things,
which doors the said william and Thomas, after the term of their
office of Bailiffs, retained for a year and a day, and caused them to be
proclaimed in full Court, at which time the said Hugh did not seek
delivery of the aforesaid doors from them, nor did he tender payment
os the rent, wherefore they contend that they ought not to answer
as to this detention, forasmuch as they took charge of the aforesaid
doors for a year and a day, and afterwards proclaimed them in full
Court, according to what the use and custom of the town aforesaid
requires. And hereupon the said Hugh denies that there is any such
use or custom allowed or approved in the town of Nottingham,
and as to this he puts himself upon the country3 and the others
likewise. Therefore the Bailiffs are commanded to cause 12 [jurors]
to come between them against thc next [Court]‚ etc.2 1295, ro. ld.

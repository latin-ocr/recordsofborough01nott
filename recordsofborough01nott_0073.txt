1270-1‚ january 17.

To every one seeing or hearing this writing XValter, by divine
permission, Archbishop of York, Primate of England, greeting in the
Author of our salvation.2 The zeal of the shepherd does not occupy
itself with the care of a part of the sold, but extends to every part of
it, so that when a member is hurt his care is not confined to it alone,
but, after the example of the Chief Shepherd, he takes pains to heal
the whole, and so by his foresight he cures the sick, that the parts
may not disagree with each other. Seeing therefore that a matter of
dispute has arisen between our beloved sons John, the Prior, and the
Convent of Shelford, on the one part, and the Community of the
Burgesses of Nottingham, on the other, in regard to a certain assart
in the field of Bassord which is called ‘ Cornerwong,'3 as also in regard
to the violence shown, as it is said, by certain of the town aforesaid on
account of the assart aforesaid, to a certain lay brother and men, as
also to the goods of the house aforesaid, and they have, after some
expenditure in suits, supplicated us with importunity that we should
ordain between them, as we shall see to be fitting for their con-
venience and honour, so that the flow of expenditure and the waste
of labour may be curtassed, and the wickedness of dissension cut
down. We, wishing to restore concord amongst our subjects, and to
lead those back to peace whom we have seen straying, not only to
the damage of their souls, but also of their bodies and goods, having

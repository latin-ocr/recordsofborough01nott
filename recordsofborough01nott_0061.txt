Pmyer: ‘O God, the father of compassion,W'1m tempering the
severity of Thy punishment, graciously permittest that the son shall
not bear the iniquity of the father, and Who by Thy wondrous dis-
pensation‚ and, using the evil kindiy, frequently exertcst through them
the favour of Thy regard, we bcseech Thy clemency, that it may be
no hindrance to this Thy servant that he has received the habit of
religion from us, unworthy as we are of so high and holy an office,
but that the mystery, which is manifested outwardly by us, Thou
mayest complete inwardly, by the gift of the Holy spirit, through the
same Our Lord‚’ etc. ‘ [Grant to] Thy servant the help of Thy divine
compassion, that the profession of sacred poverty which, by Thy in-
spiration‚ he has taken upon himself, he may by Thy protection main-
tain unbroken, through Our Lord Jesus Christ,’ etc. 4770, p. 14.

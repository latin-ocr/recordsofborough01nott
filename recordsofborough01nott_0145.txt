The Mayor and Burgesses of the town of Nottingharn claim to
have all their land, with its appurtenances, of Nottingham discharged
and quit of wastes, assarts, purprestures, and of regard or view of
foresters, verderers, regardors, or other ministers of the Forest of our
Lord King. And also they claim to have their greyhounds and
dogs at Nottingham to run and take hares and foxes beyond the
covert of the Forest. It is asked of them by what title, or by what
warram, they claim to have such liberties and profits. W ho appear
by John de Leyburn, their attorney, and he says that John sometime
Earl of Mortain‚ who was then Lord of the Castle of Nottingham
and of the whole Forest of Sherwood, having the estate and power
of granting such profits and liberties as he gave by his charter,
which he proffers here in the Court, granted to the said Mayors and
Burgesses all their land, with appurtenances, of Nottingham quit of
wastes, assarts, purprestures, and of regard or view of the foresters,
verderers, regardors, or other ministers of the Forest of the Lord
King; and to have and hold their greyhounds and dogs at Notting-
ham, to run and take hares and foxes beyond the covert of the
Forest3 but so that by reason of such liberty damage should not
be done to the Lord King, nor to his heirs, of his venison. And he
besought the Justices that all and singular the premises might be in-
quired into by the foresterS, verderers, regardors‚ and all the ministers
of the Lord King, as to how and in what way the aforesaid Mayor
and Burgesses, and their ancestors‚ have used the liberties and
profits aforesaid; wherefore an inquest was assembled, both by the
oath of all the ministers, as of other 12 upright and lawful men,
sworn to this that they should certify the Justices as to the claims
aforesaid. Who being sworn, say upon their oath that the aforesaid
Mayor and Burgesses and their antecessors, have always held all the
aforesaid land outside the regard, from the time of the granting of
the charter of the aforesaid john de Mortain until the 27th year
of the reign of King Edward the grandfather of the now Lord King.
And likewise, they say that by old custmn, and from time out
of mind, they have so held the aforesaid land outside the regard,
and have had their greyhounds and dogs within the aforesaid
land of Nottingham to run and take hares and foxes, from time

1279, July 26.

xKnow all men seeing or hearing this present writing made in
the manner of a chirograph that, whereas certain contentions have
arisen between the Burgesses of Nottingham on the one part, and the
Burgesses of Derby on the other part, as to certain exactions made
on one side or the other, as well as by toll as by the emption of live

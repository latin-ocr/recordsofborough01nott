view in the French Borough, whereof the said Agnes ought to be
dowered. And the said Agnes says that the aforesaid Thomas and
Letia held the tenements, lands, and rents of the tenements sought
and which are in view in the French Borough, on the day of
the obtaining of the writ‚ to wit, the 26th day of May, in the ninth
year of King Edward the Third from the Conquest, whereof the
said Agnes ought to be dowered, and as to this she puts herself
upon the country3 and the aforesaid Thomas and Letia likewise.
And the aforesaid Thomas and Letia say that they hold no lands‚
but they hold two messuageS, two cottages, and five shillings of rent
in the English Borough of the tenements sought and which are in
view, and not more, and they say those tenements were in the
seisin of Richard de Grimston, as of his own possession, and they say
that the aforesaid tenements are bequeathable and bequeathed like
his chattels or money, according to the custom of the town of
Nottingham‚2 and the aforesaid Richard bequeathed the aforesaid
tenements to the aforesaid Thomas and Letia‚ and they seek judg-
ment if she ought to have dower of the tenements aforesaid, against
the custom and bequest aforesaid. And the aforesaid Agnes says
that whereas the aforesid Thomas and Letia allege that the said
tenements are bequeathable and bequeaffled, and they do not allege
any custom of the said town of Nottingham, nor do they say any-
thing else by which the said Agnes ought to be excluded from her
dower, since they agree that the said tenements are bequeathable
and that she is a woman worthy of dower, and she seeks judgment‚
etc. And as to this that the aforesaid Thomas and Letia say that
they hold only so much of the tenements sought‚ the same Agnes
says that the aforesaid Thomas and Letia held, on the day of the

obtaining of the writ, all the aforesaid tenements whereof the said
Agnes claims to have her dower. 1262, ro. Sd.

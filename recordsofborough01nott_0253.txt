1383] RECORDS OF THE BOROUGII OF NOTTINGHAM. 229

whereas in the vill of Colwick, which is situate upon the said river of
Trent between the castle and town of Nottingham aforesaid and the
sea, there was heretofore a trench through which part of the said water
of Trent took its course to the mill, wears‚ and dams of Richard
Byron, of Colwick, and descending through the said wears, mill, and
dams fell into the said river of Trent, and by the force of the same
water of Trent, or by divers works, narrowing5‚ breaches or entrench-
ments made in the same trench and elsewhere in the said great river
of Trent, the right course of the aforesaid water of Trent is diverted
running wholly into the said trench to the aforesaid wears, mill,
and dams, and the said Richard held the said wears and dams close
and not open, and at the present time so holds unjustly, whereby
such ships and boats are there unable to pass or return in any
way whatsoever to the said castle and town, in contempt of us and
to the most serious damage of the same our consort, and to the no
small expense and grievance of the people aforesaid, whereupon they
have besought us to provide them a remedy in this particular: we,
wishing to do in this particular what is just, and fully confiding in
your fidelity and circumspection, have assigned you, seven, six, five,
four, three, and two of you, to fully inquire the truth by the oath of
approved and lawful men of the County of Nottingham, both within
liberties and without, by whom the truth of the matter may be best
known, as to all and singular the premises and other articles and cir-
cumstances in any wise touching them; and we therefore command
you that, on a certain day and at a certain place which you, seven,
six, five, four, three, or two of you, shall provide for this, you shall
make an inquisition as to the premiseS, and shall send it distinctly
and openly made to us in our chancery without delay, under the seals
of you, seven, six, five, four, three, or two of you, and of them by
whom it shall have been made, together with this writ. We have
commanded our Sheriff of the County aforesaid that, on a certain
day and at a certain place which you, seven, six, five, four, three, or
two of you, shall cause him to know, he shall cause to come before
you, seven, six, five, four, three, or two of you, so many and such
approved and lawful men of his bailliwick, both within liberties and
without, by whom the truth of the matter as to the premis-es may be
best known and inquired. In testimony whereof we have caused
these our letters to be made patent. &Vitness myself at &Vestminsten
the 16 day of November, in the seventh year of our reign. 'Waltham

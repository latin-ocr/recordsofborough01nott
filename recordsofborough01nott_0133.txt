greeting. Know ye that, whereas by the chartei· of Lord Edward of
renowned memory, late King of England‚ our grandfather, it was
granted to the Burgesses of our town of Nottingham that the same
Burgesses, in each year, in the feast of Saint Michael, should elect a
Mayor from themselves ‘to be set over the Bailiffs and others of the
same borough in everything which pertains to the government and
advantage of the same town, and that they shall at once, the same
election having been made, elect one Bailiff of one borough and
another for the other borough, on account of the diversity of customs
existing in the same boroughs, who shall execute those things which
pertain to their office‚'1 and the aforesaid Burgesses have besought
us that, whereas in one of the boroughs aforesaid, on account of the
poverty and insufficiency of the inhabitants of the same, they are
unable at present to find a sufficient bailiff to execute that office, we
should grant them that in the same town, in places which may seem
to be better expedient, they may elect the said two bailiffs: ⁷We,
favourably inclining to their prayer in this particular, have granted
them that they, after the election of the same Mayor has been made,
as is aforesaid, shall have power to elect the said two Bailiffs out of
the better and more sufficient persons of the same town, in places
which may seem to them to be better expedient, who shall execute
those things which pertain to their office, the said words contained
in the aforesaid charter of our grandfather notwithstanding. In
testimony whereof we have caused these our letters to be made
patent, to endure as long as it shall please us. XVitness myself at
Woodstock‚ the first day of May, in the fourth year of our reign.

By the King himself and Council.

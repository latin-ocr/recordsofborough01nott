1‘Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made [heaven and
earth] .’2 ‘ Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth [and
for evermore].’3 ‘Let us pray, beloved brethren, Our Lord Jesus
Christ for this His servant, R. R„ who hastens to cut away the hair of
his head for His love, that He may give him the Holy Ghost, who
shall keep on him for ever the dress of religion, and preserve his
heart from worldly hindrance or desire, and as one is transformed in
face, so His right hand may give him increase of virtue, and open
his eyes from all human blindness, and grant him the light of eternal
glory. Who with God the Father [and the Holy Ghost lives and
reigns for ever and ever'].

Another Prayer: ‘Be present, O Lord! at our supplications‚ and
deign to bless this Thy servant R. R„ upon whom we place the habit
of religion in Thy holy name, that he may by Thy gift be worthy to
remain dex-out in Thy church, and to receive eternal life, through
Our Lord Jesus Christ [who lives and reigns with Thee in unity,
the Holy Ghost].’

[Benediction of tlze z'eslment] ‘O Lord Jesus Christ, who didst
deign to put on the covering of our mortality, we beseech the immense
abundance of Thy goodness, that Thou mayst so deign to bless this
kind of vestment, which the holy fathers have decreed should be
borne by those who renounce the world, as a token of innocence and
humility‚ that this Thy servant, who shall [use it], may deserve to
put on Thee, who lives [and reigns God for evermore].’ Whilst he
divests himself, let him say ‘May the Lord put off from thee the
old man with his deeds !' Whilst he puts on him the new habit,
let him say ‘May the Lord put on thee the new man, which is
created after God in righteousness and true holiness ! ’11 After he has
been dressed, these prayers shall be said: ‘Save thy servant, O my
God, who trusts in Thee. Send him, O Lord, help from the sanc-
tuary, and strengthen him out of Sion.12 Let not the enemy do him
violence, nor the son of wickedness hurt him.13 Be thou, O Lord,
to him a strong tower from the face of the enemy l1⁴ The Lord be
with you. And with [thy spirit].' ’

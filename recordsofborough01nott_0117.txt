Also, to the second article, they say that the said hospital was so
endowed that of the possessior15, lands and tenements, goods and
chattels given and granted to the said hospital, a master, the chap-
lains celebrating divine service therein, the brethren and sisters and
poor of the same house, ought to be sustained in common, without
property of their own. And of the possessions assigned and granted
to the said house of old time, they have not knowledge without in-
spection of the charters and writings remaining in the possession
of the master of the said hospitai; and it is not evident to them
whether aught has been thence subtracted, or not.

Also, to the third article, they say that there used to be in the

Also, to the sixth article, they say that divine service was eele-
brated in the same, as is contained in a certain rule ordained and
made by Lord &Valter de Grey, sometime Archbishop of York, and
written in a certain leaf upon the missal of the same house, which has
now for a long time been maliciously cut out and abstracted by the
wardens for the time being; which same leaf by divine grace has

Also, to the seventh article, they say that the master and brethren
are bound to obey the ruie contained in the said leaf.

Also, to the eighth article, they say that the master, or any one

xiv INTRODUCTION.

to S. John's Hospital were entered in the Red Book. This was
probably done when the possessions of that hospital were granted
to the town. There is no reason to doubt that Greaves copied these
charters out of that work. There were other grants entered which
Greaves did not excerpt, for, after exemplifying several of the
charters printed in the following pages, he remarks: ‘hic sequuntur
donationes apud Nott.: reliquae in aliis loeis omissae.'1 It may
be noted that all the papers relating to S. John’s Hospital given by
Greaves are here printed, and that his spelling of the name ‘Not-
tingham’ has been adhered to. At p. 48 of his notes, at the end
of a brief abstract of the royal charters, occur the two following
entries: ‘This2 hath beene reputed Aleditcrralzea pars Regni? the
confine of the south and the key betwixt the south and the north.'
‘English fugitives. Oretur pro Rege; ut Deus donet ei vitam pro-
lixam, imperium securum, domum tutam, exercitus fortes, senatum
fidelem, populum probum, orbem denique quietum'4 This is,
apparently, a reminiscence of the Civil &Vars¹ in which Robert
Greaves suffered great loss.

6. The loss of many of the Mayoralty Rolls is greatly to be
regretted. Of the period covered by this volume there are only
two of these rolls now in existence, one of these (No. CIX„ p. 200)
being preserved in an imperfect state. The other one, No. 3942,
has contributed a quantity of interesting matter, as may be seen
from the extracts from it printed at pp. 268, 284, 280, 288, 292, 308
312, 316, 322. Of the eontents of this Roll it is unnecessary to
speak, for the extracts from it amply represent its contents. A
later Mayoralty Roll has yielded the notice of the immunity of the
Burgesses from the Forest Laws printed at p. 120, which is copied
from. a schedule affixed to the Roll.

tingham possess a great number of original deeds, mostly relating

Alice Baxter‚ complainant‚ appeared against Hugh Draper and
Richard Lister, late Bailiffs of the town of Nottingham, on a plea
that they unjustly detain a brass pot, of the value of ten shillings,
to the damage of the said Alice of two shillings, wherefore, etc. And
the said Hugh and Richard come, and defend the force, etc., and
say that they justly‚ and not unjustly‚ detain the said pot for three
pounds of the portion of the ferm of the Lord King, which the said
Alice and other men of her craft of baking are bound to pay annually
to the Bailiffs of the town aforesaid, which three pounds were never
paid them for the time of their bailiwick, therefore they say that
they justly‚ and not unjustly‚ detain the aforesaid pot for that reason,
and they seek that this may be inquired; and the said Alice likewise.
Therefore the Bailiffs are commanded to cause 12 jurors to come
between them against the next Court.1 1280, ΓΟ· 3d·

CLXXXVII.—Csmage of Assaldl against tlte Sub-Bal'lgff
1399, August 6.

Custance1 Rysum makes plaint of John Lovel on a pica of
trespass‚ wherefore he is attached; and hereupon she makes plaint
that the said John, on a certain day and at a certain place here at
Nofflngham, made an assault upon the said Joan unjustly and
against the peace, and beat her with his club, to the damage of the
said Joan of 4os., etc. And the said John comes, justifying the said
deed, and he says that he, at the day and place aforesaid, according
to his office of sub-bailiff of Nottingham‚ arrested the said Joan at
the suit of one Isabella Durnys for a plea of trespass and battery,
which arrest the said Joan resisted, on account of which resistance
and rescue the said John in support of his office struck her until
she would go to prison with him, wherefore it is not incumbent upon
him to further answer to the said Joan, and this, etc. And hereupon
the said Joan says that she did not resist the said arrest, but that
the said John from his own initiative beat her, and she seeks that this
may be inquired; and the said John likewise. Therefore let an
inquest be summoned between them against the next Court.

1392] REcoRDs OF THE BOROUGH oF NOTTINGHAM. 415

Richard Byron in Over Colwick3 and that the said William de Colwick and
Richard Byron have made a wear in the aforesaid trench there with growing
trees, stones and timbers fixed, from one shore of the aforesaid trench
athwart the whole of that trench to the mill aforesaid on the other side of
the trench aforesaid; and that the aforesaid Richard Byron and Joan his
wife, as of the right of the same Joan, at this time hold the aforesaid wear
there closed and not open, as parcel of the manor of Over Colwick of
the same Richard Byron and Joan3 and that the place where the said
water of Trent formerly held its course is now filled with earth, sand, and
willows‚ so that the water of Trent aforesaid cannot be converted into its
right course without expenses which are not reasonably supportable, whereby
ships and boats with victuals and other merchandise cannot pass or return
by any means by the said water of Trent to the aforesaid Castle and town
of Nottingham, as they were accustomed to do at all times past, in contempt
of the King, and to the very grave damage of Anne, Queen of England,
and to the no small expense and grievance of the people of the adjacent
parts. And moreover they say, that the water of Trent aforesaid formerly
held its course, before it was diverted from its right course, between the
vill of Adbolton on the one side and the vill of Over Colwick on the other
side. And moreover they say, that they are entirely ignorant as to who
is bound by right to convert the aforesaid water of Trent into its ancient
right course. In testimony whereof the jurors aforesaid have placed their
seals to this inquest. Dated at Nottingham, on the day and year above-
written.'¹

And now at the same Octave of the Holy Trinity, in this same term,
before our Lord the King, at Nottingham, the jurors of divers wapentakes
of the County aforesaid present, that the course of the water of Trent from
the town of Nottingham to the Humber is blocked up by a kidell lately
made at Over Colwick‚ about the feast of Saint Michael, in the fifteenth
year of the reign of King Richard the Second after the Conquest‚ by
Richard Byron, knight, whereby boats and small craft with divers mer-
chandise and other victuals in the water of Humber cannot come to the
town of Nottingham, as of old time they were accustomed, to the serious
detriment of the whole people of the County aforesaid and of other Counties
next adjoining. Also, they present that the river of Trent, which has its
right course from the water of Humber to the town of Nottingham, with
divers boats and small craft coming with divers merchandise and other
victuals to the aforesaid town of Nottingham, for the ease of the whole

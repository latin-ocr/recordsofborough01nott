upon a draught-horse‚ and that they should return from the said
town of &Vest Chester upon the said horses to the town of Notting-
ham without any delay, so that if one of them should arrive later
than the other at the town of Noffingham, he should give to the other
arriving before him 2os. of silver on the morrow of his arrival, and
hereupon the aforesaid John came to the aforesaid Henry on the day
assigned, and warned him to come and fulfil the aforesaid agreement ;

to the damage of the said John of 4od., wherefore he enters suit, etc.

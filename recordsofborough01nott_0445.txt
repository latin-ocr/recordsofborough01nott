1392] RECORDS OF TlIE BOROUGII OF NOTTINGHAM. 421

water of Trent is one of the great rivers of England which, wherever it
turns, ought by law to be open and common for the passage of ships and
boats with victuals and other merchandise whatsoever, and they do not deny
that the course of the aforesaid water of Trent from old time was wont to
run through the aforesaid vill of Adbolton‚ but they expressly acknowledge
it, which place in which the course of the aforesaid water of Trent was wont
to run is now so much filled up by sand, earth, growing willows, piles, and
by the force of the water aforesaid, and in other ways, that no course of
water exists there now, but it wholly turns into the trench aforesaid, and
so it manifestly appears that ships and boats with merchandise and other
victuals, etc., are not able to go to, or return from, the aforesaid town in the
place in which they were wont‚ as they were accustomed to do in old time 3
and also because they acknowledge that they hold the wear aforesaid, where
the aforesaid water of T rent now wholly runs, close and not open, so that
ships and boats are unable to go or return in the course of the water in
any manner whatever, as of right and according to law they should do3
all and singular of which the aforesaid Edmund is prepared to verify for our
Lord the King: he seeks judgment that the wear aforesaid be removed
and cast down, etc. And the aforesaid Richard and Joan seek judgment,
that because the matter alleged by them above is sufficient in law to annul
the aforesaid presentments and everything which is above alleged on behalf
of our Lord the King, and that they may be therein exonerated against
our Lord the King upon his aforesaid impleading. And the aforesaid
Edmund Brudenel seeks judgment for our Lord the King, because the
matter above alleged by the aforesaid Richard and Joan is not a sufficient
answer in law against the presentments aforesaid and the matter alleged
against them on behalf of our Lord the King, and that the aforesaid wear
and all the aforesaid nuisance be removed and wholly thrown down. There-
fore it is decided that the wear aforesaid and all other nuisances therein be
cast down and removed, so that ships and boats with victuals and other
merchandise may go and return to and from the aforesaid water of Humber
to the said town and Castle of Nottingham by the course of the water of
T rent aforesaid, etc. And the Sheriff of the County aforesaid is commanded
to throw down and remove the wear aforesaid and all other nuisances therein
without delay, etc., so that ships and boats with victuals and other mer-
chandise may go and return from the aforesaid water of Humber to the
said town and Castle by the course of the water of Trent, etc: and the
aforesaid Richard is in ‘misericordia,’ ete. 4421 b.

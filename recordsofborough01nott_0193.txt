1358, March 28.

John de verdon, os Brikelsworth, knight‚ and Matilda his wife,
by John Lynering their attorney, claim from Walter de Gotham, of
Nofflngham, a moiety of four messuages and of a rent of a hundred
shillings, with appurtenances, in Nottingharn, as the dower of the said
Matilda from the dowry of Ralph de Crophull‚ knight, late her
husband. Whereupon the said Walter comes, and says that whereas
she seeks dower of a moiety‚ it is clear that this is against the
common law without any special reason, and therefore he demands
judgment. And the aforesaid John and Matilda say that the afore-
said messuages and rent are in the English Borough of the liberty of
’ the town of Noffingham, within which English Borough women
should be dowered with a moiety of the lands and tenements of
their husbands‚ by the custom of the Borough aforesaid, and they
demand her dower. And as regards the rent, the said Walter says

thereupon, etc.; and as to the four messuages he answers as tenant,

the husband sells lands or tenements within the Borough afore-

of the husband and of the wife, and for their common use, that the
wife ought not to have dower after the death of her husband of the
tenements so sold, whereof the money thence accruing has been so
expended, in form aforesaid; and moreover he says that Ralph de
Crophill, formerly the husband of the said Matilda, of whose dowry
they now claim, sold the said four messuages to a certain XValter
de Lincoln‚ aneestor of the aforesaid Walter, of whom he (XValter de
Gotham) is the heir, and the money which thereos arose was
expended for the common use of the said Ralph and Matilda, and
he demands judgment if she ought to have her dowry thereos. And
the aforesaid John and Matilda say that the aforesaid &Valter is full
tenant of the rent aforesaid, as they suppose by their writ, and
they secl< that this may be inquired; and the other likewise. And
the aforesaid John and Matilda say that whereas the said Walter
alleges generally that when money is received from lands and tene-
ments sold in the aforesaid Borough, and expended in* form aforesaid,

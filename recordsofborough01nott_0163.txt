day next after the feast of Saint Euphemia the Virgin, in the 16th
year of the reign of King Edward the Third after the Conquest‚ the
Burgesses of the town of Nottingham appeared, and claimed that
they were free of giving Thelonium, and hereupon they brought with
them the charters of the progenitors of the Lord Edward now King
of England‚ confirmed by the charter of the same the now Lord
King: in which charter it is contained that the Burgesses of the
town of Nottingham shall be quit throughout the whole land of
the King of England‚ within and without fairs‚ to wit, of Theolonium,
Murage, Pavage, Pontage‚ Tronage, Stallage, Tragium, Quayage,
Pikagium, Lastage, and Passage. And hereupon Master william de
Finchden‚ Steward of the said Court of Sir John Darcy‚ the Cousin‚
took an inquisition by virtue of his office by the oath of william de
Kelfeld, and other jurors, whether the aforesaid Burgesses of the
town of Nottingham were accustomed to give Theolonium, and
the other aforesaid customs, at Torksey, by land or by water, within
fairs or without, after the dates of the making of the aforesaid

that the Burgesses of the aforesaid town of Nottingham have not
been accustomed at any time after the dates of the making of the
aforesaid charters to give Theolonium, or the other aforesaid customs‚
within or without fairs, by land or by water, within the demesne of
Torksey. Therefore it is decided that the Burgesses of the aforesaid
town of Nottingham shall henceforth there go quit, without giving
Theolonium, or the other aforesaid customs. 4389.

viii INTRODUCTION.

of being called a volume, but it was unfortunately burnt in the
fire which occurred at the Town Clerk's office in 1724 This book
was called, according to a practice of which it is possible to pro-
duce many examples, from the colour of its binding, ‘the Red
Book.’ Judging from the scanty notices which have come down to
us of the contents of this book, it contained the customs of the town,
entries of orders made by the community long before the creation
of the governing Council, etc.; so that the name of Nottingham may
be added to the long list of towns which have lost their customals.1

records now preserved in the strong-rooms of the Corporation of
Nottingham, with one exception, that of the Charter of Edward I.
(No. XXVI., p. 56), which is printed from the enrolment upon the
Charter Rolls in order to fill up the series of charters. As will be
perceived, the extracts are printed in the original language, to
which an English translation has been added. It is hoped that
this system will satisfy the wants of the student, for whom it is
an absolute necessity to have access to historica] matter in its
original language, and will also render these documents available
for the cursory reader. The originals of the several passages have
been faithfully adhered t0, obvious errors being corrected in the
body of the extracts and the original forms preserved in the
footnotes. The principle acted upon in the selection of the extracts
has been to excerpt not only what is of interest to the curious, but
whatever seemed to be of value for the history of the town, its
institutions, customS‚ etc.; and this must be the excuse for the pub-
lication of much that may appear dry and worthless to the general
reader. The intention held in view has been, therefore, to provide
such a body of Orlgines for the history of the town as shall render
the principal matter stored up in the records available to the student
of local history. The selection of such matter must always be an
invidious task, much being omitted that it were, perhaps, desirable

to have included, and vice versas

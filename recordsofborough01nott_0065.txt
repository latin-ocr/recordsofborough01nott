HENRY, by the Grace of God, King of England‚ Lord of Ireland,
Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine‚ and Earl of Anjou‚ to his arch-
bishops, bishops‚ abbots, priors, earls, barons‚ justices, sheriffs‚ reeves,
ministers‚ and all his bailiffs and faithful subjects, greeting. Know ye
that we have granted, and by this our present charter have con-
firmed, to our Burgesses of Nottingham, that they and their heirs
shall have for ever throughout our land and jurisdiction this liberty,
that is to say, that they or their goods, in whatsoever places found
within our jurisdiction‚ shall not be arrested for any debt of which
they are not the pledges or principal debtors, except in case the
debtors are of their commune and power, having whereof their debts
may be wholly or partly satisfied, and the said Burgesses shall
have failed in doing justice to the creditors of the same debtors‚ and
that this can be reasonably made to appear. We have also granted,
and by this our charter have confirmed to the same Burgesses, that
they shall have for ever th'e return of our writs of summons of our
exchequer, in everything pertaining to our borough of Nottingham,
so that no sheriff, or other bailiff or minister of ours, shall hereafter
intermeddle with the execution of these summonses or distresses in
the aforesaid borough‚ unless through the default of the said Bur-
gesses or Bailiffs of the same borough. Wherefore we will and firmly
enjoin, for us and our heirs, that the aforesaid Burgesses and their
heirs shall have for ever the before-written liberties as is aforesaid:
and we prohibit, under pain of forfeiture to us of ten pounds‚ any one
from vexing, disturbing‚ or disquieting them against these liberties.
These being witnesses: Roger le Bigot Earl of Norfolk Marshal of
England, Ralph Fitz-Nicholas‚ John de Lexington‚ Richard de Grey,
W'illiam de Grey, Humbert Poieys, Walkelin de Aerden, Peter
Everard, William Gernon, and others. Given by our hands at

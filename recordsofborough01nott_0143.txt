1330, December 19.

Thomas de Hinkley makes plaint of John de Torlaton that the
same John unjustly detains from him a cart bound with iron, of the
value of 13s. 4d., and unjustly because, whereas Daniel de Lincoln,
the Lord King’s sub-bailiff of Nottingham, was assigned by the
Coroner of the Household of the Lord King, on Thursday next
after the feast of Saint Matthew the Apostle,1 to take carriage for
the use of the Lord King at Leicester, the aforesaid Daniel came
and took the cart of the aforesaid Thomas, on the aforesaid day,
and delivered the aforesaid cart to the aforesaid John de Torlaton
to carry the victuals of the Lord King at Loughborough, and to lead
back the aforesaid cart and to deliver it back to Thomas de Hinkley
on the Sunday next following, on which day the aforesaid John
never led back the aforesaid cart, nor delivered it to the said Thomas,
but detained it, and detains it, to the damage of the same Thomas
of 20s., and hereupon he enters suit. And the aforesaid John
comes, and says that he detains no cart of the aforesaid Thomas,
as the same Thomas has set forth against him, and this he offers to
verify; and the aforesaid Thomas likewise. It is found by an inquest
that the aforesaid John detains from the aforesaid Thomas a cart,
of the value of Ss, to the damage of the same Thomas of 25. There-
fore it is decided that the aforesaid Thomas shall recover from the
aforesaid John the aforesaid cart, or its price, together with damages,
which are taxed at 2d., and the aforesaid John is in ‘misericordia'
sor unjust detention. 1261, ro. 6.

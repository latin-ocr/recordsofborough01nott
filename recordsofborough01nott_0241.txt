william Leech was summoned to answer to John de Eaton on
a plea of agreement, why he has not kept the agreement made
between them; and thereupon he makes plaint that 1 at
Nottingham, in the fourth year of the reign of the present king, it
was so agreed between the aforesaid John and William that the
aforesaid John should deliver to the said william ten shillings, to
the help of the hundred marks of the loan made to the Lord King
by the burgesses of Nottingham‚ upon condition that the aforesaid
John should have back the aforesaid ten shillings on the first day
upon which any one, who had contributed any money to the loan to
the Lord King at that time, should have their money back, wherefore
the said John delivered ten shillings to the same william, according
to the aforesaid agreement, and afterwards many persons were satisfied
of the sum paid by them to the loan made to the Lord King at the
same time, wherefore the aforesaid John frequently afterwards desired
the aforesaid William to keep the agreement made between them,
and he desires up to this time; the said william refused to keep that
agreement, and up to this time refuses, to the damage of the said
John of 13s. 4d., and hereupon, etc. And the said william comes,
and defends the force, etc., and says that he broke no agreement
with him, and he seeks that this may be inquired. Therefore the
Bailiffs are commanded to cause an inquest to come between them
against the next Court. 1281, ro. 5.

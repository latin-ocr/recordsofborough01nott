RICHARD, by the Grace of God, King of England and France,
and Lord of Ireland, to his well-beloved and faithful John de Grey,
of Codnor, knight, Henry de Grey, of wilton, knight, william de
Burgh‚ Robert de Morton, and Robert Martell, greeting. WVhereas
we are given to understand that very many wears‚ mills, dama pales,
and kidells, have now of late been fixed and raised in the water
of Trent, in the County of Nottingham, by which ships and boats
used to pass with victuals and other wares, so that by the raising
of the same the course of the water aforesaid is so wholly diverted,
obstructed, and narrowed, that ships and boats are unable to pass

wearS, mills, pools, pales, and kidells, and all other defects of the
water aforesaid, and to inquire by the oath of upright and lawful men
of the aforesaid county, as well within liberties as without, by whom
the truth of the matter may be best known, what and what manner
of wears‚ mills, pools, pales, and kidells were fixed and erected in
the water aforesaid in the time of Lord Edward, the son of King
Henry, our progenitor, sometime King of England, and afterwards,
and by whom, at what time, how and in what manner, and to cause
all such wears‚ mins, pools, pales, and kidells, and other defects
of the aforesaid water, by which the transit of ships and boats is
impeded, according to the form, force, and effect of the statutes and
ordinations aforesaid, to be removed and displaced, with all the spced
which can be used, by those who so erected and placed them, and
by others who are bound to do this, without their re-erection, and
to cause them to do this by the ways and means which shall seem
best to be done, and to compel and distrain them, and to take, and
arrest, and deliver to our prisons all those who to you, or any one of

our heirs each year, at our exchequer, fifty-two poundS, in the form
in which they were before accustomed to render them to us therefore,
and that they render annually therefore notwithstanding to us and
our heirs eight pounds by way of increment. And we have granted,
for us and our heirs‚ for the alleviation of the estate of the Burgesses
and other men of the same town, that they shall henceforth have in
the same town a mayor from amongst themselves, whom, the bur-
gesses of both boroughs of the same town being assembled each
year in the feast of Saint Michael, they shall elect with unanimous
consent and will, to be set over the bailiffs and others of the same
borough in everything pertaining to the government and advantage
of the same town, and that they shall at once, the same election
having been made, elect one bailiff of one borough and another for
the other borough, on account of the diversity of customs existing in
the same boroughs, who shall execute those things which pertain to
their office. And that they and their successors, besides their fair
lasting for eight days at the feast of Saint Matthew the Apostle, shall
have for ever one other fair in the same town each year to endure for
fifteen days, that is to say, on the eve, the day, and the morrow of the
feast of Saint Edmund the King and Martyr, and for the twelve days
following, unless this fair shall be to the damage of neighbouring
fairs. WVherefore we will and firmly enjoin, for ourselves and our
heirs, that the aforesaid Burgesses and men and their successors,
besides their fair lasting for eight days at the feast of Saint Matthew
the Apostle, shall have for ever one other fair in the same town every
year to endure for fifteen days, to wit, on the eve, the day, and the
morrow of the feast of Saint Edmund the King and Martyr, and for
the twelve days following, with all liberties and free customs per-
taining to such a fair, unless this fair shall be to the damage of
neighbouring fairs, as is aforesaid. These being witnesses: the
venerable fathers Robert, Bishop of Bath and wells, and Antony,
Bishop of Durham, Thomas de Clare, Otto de Grandison, John
de Vescy, Robert Tibetot‚ Robert Fitz-John, and others. Given as
above [2'.e., ‘Given by our hand at Lincoln‚ on the 12th day of
February ’]. Rot. Chartamm, 12 Ed. I., No. 51.

ham, and the Brethren there serving God, and S. John the Baptist
greeting and benediction. Since it is agreed amongst men of re-
ligion that order be observed, because without order there is no
religion, we ordain, and firmly enjoin, that whosoever shall be
warden or master of the Housc of Saint John the Baptist of Not-
tingham, shall so provide that there be two chaplains, or more, cele-
brating divine service there for ever. Morem-er, we ordain that all
the brethren shall rise together for Matina and in such time that
Matins may be sung before morning, or at daybreak‚ from the feast
of S. Michael to Easter; and, Prime and Tierce having been there-
after sung, Mass shall be celebrated ; and after Mass, Sext and None
having been sung, the brethren shall attend to the affairs of the
house, each one as is proper to the duty deputed to him3 and
they shall hear Vespers and Compline‚ when not prevented by
reasonable or necessary hindrance. We also ordain that all shall be
regularly obedient to their warden or master, without gainsaying or
murmur. And no one shall be a proprietor, but if any one have
any property, he shall resign it to the warden or master before seven
days after the promulgation of this precept, otherwise he shall be
excommunicated on the same seventh day, by the mere fact of re-
taining property. The warden or master shall convert his property,
if he have any, to the use of the house. But if it shall be found
that any one has died with property, his body shall be cast out from
Christian burial‚ and shall be buried elsewhere, his property being
thrown upon him by the brethren saying, ‘May thy money perish
with thee !’11 No one shall have a locked chest, unless it be the
chest assigned to his office. All shall be dressed, fed, and shall drink
in common, and shall not eat meat except on three days in the
week, to wit, on Sumiay, Tuesday, and Thursday‚ except by the
permission of the warden. They shall eat together in one refectory,
preserving silence during the meal, or shall speak in a low voice if
necessity shall compel them say aught. All shall lie together in one
dormstory, clothed in breeches and in shirts, or in thc garment which
they use instead of a shirt; and they shall go to bed at the hour at

william de 13311116)ν complains of william Metel, that the same
william Metel came in the town of Nottingham to the bar which is
called ‘ Chapellebarre,’ and arrested two carts with wood given to him
by the Abbot of Dale for his fire, for pontage, whereas no pontage
should have been given, until the said william pledged a pair of
gloves for the said 63115, 10 1116 damage of the said william de
Bathley of los, and of this he enters suit. And the aforesaid william
Metal comes, and defends the force, etc., and says that he asked the
said William de Bathley to make oath that no merchandise was in
the said wood, and he would not, and therefore he vindicates the
taking of the said pledge. And the said william Bathley1 says that
he swore that there was no merchandise in the said wood, and this
he will verify: and the said william Metal denies this, and this he
will verify, and he likewise. Therefore let a good inquest be sum-
moned. 1255, ro. 6.

Philip Tusard of Nottingham was attached to answer to Cecily
who was the wife of Richard de Bridgeford‚ of Noffingham, on a plea
of the caption of chattels; and hereupon the said Cecily complains
that the same Philip, on the eve of the Nativity of the Lord last past,
in the town of Nottingham‚ in the house of the said Cecily lying next
to the house of william le Cotiler‚ took two brass pots of the said
Cecily's‚ of the value of 105. [Τ116 defendant justifies this distress by
producing a grant from Richard de Bridgeford and his wife the afore-
said Cecily, to the said Philip of 3 16111 of 125. issuing from the said
messuage. This grant is dated April 23, 1313] And the aforesaid
Cecily says that the said Philip cannot justify the said caption as
good and just in this particular, for 5116 says that by common right
and the law of the land no one of the town of Nottingham can
alienate or sell a tenement of his wifc's right, or burden 11 with a rent,
except by a fine thereupon levied in the Lord King’s Court, or the
wife being examined in the Court of Nottingham before the Mayor

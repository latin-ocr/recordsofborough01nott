vi PREFACE.

information throwing light upon the customs and manners
of those early times, should be lost, and the labour and
expense already incurred thrown away.

The Finance Committee determined‚ therefore, to print
a volume of extracts with translations. In order that the
work might be presented to the public With an assurance
of its accmacy, the extracts and translations have been
revised by the Rev. james Raine, MA, of York Cathedral,
the learned Secretary of the Surtees Society.

The first instalment of the work is now presented to
the public, and the committee hope that the reception
accorded to it will warrant its continuance.

Town Clerks are by statute the keepers of the corporate
records, subject to the directions of the Council. These
records, in many instances‚ contain matters of more than
local importance, which will remain hidden in the archives
of our towns, until Councils are convinced of the importance
of publishing them.

SAM. GEO. JOHNSON,
Tawn Clerk.

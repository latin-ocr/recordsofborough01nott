1325, September 21.

ΙΧΧἸΙᾸᾸΑΜ, by divine permissiom Archbishop of York, Primate of
England, to his well-beloved son Sir Matthew de Halifax, Master of
the Hospital of Saint John the Baptist near Nottingham‚ greeting,
grace, and benediction. XVhereas it is known to be incumbent upon
our pastoral duty, and the weighty direction 01 1116 6316 assumed
by us urges us not only to spread abroad as much as possible the
worthy services of God, but also to gather them up when scattered,
so that the divine religion may thereby be more devotedly increased
to the praise of God, and may be brought to everlasting remem-
brance. XVhereas two or three brethren have been used of old to
dwell in the said hospital, and, leading a religious life all their time,
there to serve God laudably in divine services; it having 601116 10
0111 hearing that thou presumest to stay alone in the said hospital, so
that if thou wert to fall sick thou wouldst have no one who could
relieve thee, 10 1116 diminution of the said worship of God, and to the
scandal of the multitude, we enjoin and command thee that thou
shall take care to receive, without delay, one or two fit persons as
thy brethren, as the means of the same house will admit, for the
honour 01 God and the increase of His religion, and whom, having
received to thyself, thou shalt cause to be provided by thee with a
decent habit, such as the brethren there were used to wear in times
past, which we strongly desire that thou and they shall use here—
after, rendering to the Highest prayers and daily and nightly services,
as it has there generally been accustomed with solemnity from old
time: which same brethren and their successors in the aforesaid
hospital, when they have there professed, we decree and also
ordain should devote the whole 01 111611 lives to the Saviour 01
all, which profession thou shalt receive from these brethren, and
from each 01 1116111, as the orders of the canons direct. In witness
whercof our scal is appendet] to these presentS. Fare ye well!
Given at XVhatton in our diocese, on the 11th of the Kalends
of October, in the year of the Lord one thousand three hundred
and twenty—five, and in the eighth year of our pontificate.

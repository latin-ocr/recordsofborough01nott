3. The first in importance of the sources from which the following
pages have been drawn, is the series of Royal Charters. Of these
Nottingham possesses an interesting collection, marking the progress
of municipal liberty until the borough was created a County. In-
deed, two of these charters have been of sufficient interest to the
constitutional historian to find an honoured place amongst the
valuable documents printed in Professor Stubbs' select Charters
and other Illustrations of English Constantiana! Hz'stoffyff The date
of the grant of one of these has been carried back probably eleven
years by the publication of the hitherto unknown charter of John
granted during the reign of his brother Richard I. A fac-simile
of the Charter of Henry II. is bound up with this volume, and
from this an idea may be formed of the two charters of John.
The subsequent Charters call for no special description, their form
being that of the usual Letters Patent.

4 Next in importance to the Royal Charters come the Rolls
of the Borough Court. These contain the records of the proceed-
ings of the Borough Court, of which the following account is given
in the Report of the Commissioners on Municipal Corporaffions,
1835: ‘The Mayor and Sheriffs' Court is a Court of Record‚ holding
pleas in all actions, real, personal, and mixed, to any amount. The
Court is held every fortnight‚ before the mayor and sheriffs .....
The process is by capias, serviceable or bailable, as the case may
require, and the practice is similar to that of the courts at XVest-
minster' (p. 1994). This Court has gradually fallen into disuse
since the introduction of the modern system of County Courts.
During the period covered by this volume this Court was held on
alternate WVednesdays, with very rare exceptions. Pleas between
inhabitants of the town were alone entered upon the Rolls, separate
rolls being kept for the plcas between strangers‚ or in which a
stranger was concerned. These latter rolls are entitled ‘Rotulus
Placitorum Forinsecorum' (Roll of Extraneous Pleas), and occa-

sionally ‘Curia Placitorum Pipoudcrorum' (the Court of Pleas os
